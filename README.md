In this task I used Asp.net Core 3.1.0 for backend, Repository pattern to handle crud operations
Entity framework As an ORM and MVC,LINQ, Html, CSS, JavaScript to work with frontend, Asp.net core Identity for user registration and login 

Steps to use the rental system:-  
1- Register the Client account  
2- Login the Client with the registered username and password  
3- Client can choose the car to rent, if the car is available then he will be redirected to the rent contract else the alert message will be displayed   
4- Cars can be added to the table by using the car page.
